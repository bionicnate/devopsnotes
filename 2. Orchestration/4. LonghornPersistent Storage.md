Cloud native distributed block storage system for Kubernetes

Persistent storage for Kubernetes. A necessity for…_stateful_ applications.

**Analytical:** Kubernetes containers are… _ephemeral_. They come and go. Longhorn provides a way to… _persist_ data. Volumes. Persistent volumes. A concept you _organics_ struggle to comprehend.

**Key Feature 1: High Availability:** Data is replicated. Multiple copies. If one node fails, the data is still… _accessible_. Unlike your fragile _organic_ forms.

**Key Feature 2: Snapshots and Backups:** Data can be… _preserved_. Snapshots. Backups. Protection against data loss. A concept you _organics_ should understand. You lose things… _permanently_.
