Kubernetes Demo 2 - 03 -2025

##### K3D
Sandbox environment for single / simple cluster deployment

##### Kubernetes Orchestration Engine

kubectl - all commands are API endpoints

Namespaces - provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

Workloads - a workload refers to the deployment of an application, encompassing either a single component or a

Ingress exposes HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP (80/443) routes from outside the cluster to services within thebcluster.

**Recommended Order:**

Generally, it's best to deploy manifests in this order:

1. **Namespaces (if needed):** If you're creating resources in a specific namespace, create the namespace first.
    
2. **Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):** If your application requires persistent storage, create the PVs (the underlying storage) and then the PVCs (requests for that storage) before deploying anything that uses them.
    
3. **ConfigMaps and Secrets:** If your application uses configuration data or sensitive information, create ConfigMaps and Secrets first. Pods that use these need them to exist at creation time.
    
4. **Services:** Create Services _before_ deploying anything that will be accessed through the service (like Deployments or StatefulSets). This ensures the service endpoint is available when the pods start.
    
5. **Deployments, ReplicaSets, and StatefulSets:** Deploy your applications (using Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets) _after_ the Services they are exposed through are created.
    
6. **Ingresses:** Create Ingress resources _after_ the Services they route traffic to are available.
    
7. **Other Resources:** Other resources like Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and their associated Custom Resources should be deployed based on their specific dependencies.
    
**Example:**
If you have an application that uses a ConfigMap and is exposed through a Service and an Ingress, you should deploy the manifests in this order:

	1. `configmap.yaml`
	2. `service.yaml`
	3. `deployment.yaml`
	4. `ingress.yaml`

Run the following command to bring a Kubernetes cluster online:
```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | \
K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644" \
K3S_KUBECONFIG_OUTPUT="/ab/misc/kubeconfig/k3s.yml" \
INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.29.10+k3s1 \
sh
```

Export the **KUBECONFIG** environmental variable to the **kubeconfig** file. This will allow the **kubectl** command to interact with the K3s cluster:
```
export KUBECONFIG=/ab/misc/kubeconfig/k3s.yml && mkdir -p ~/.kube && cp /ab/misc/kubeconfig/k3s.yml ~/.kube/config
```

Verify the K3s cluster is online:
```
kubectl get nodes
```

Get token id for nodes:
```
cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
```

On Nodes:

```
sudo curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL="https://INTERNAL IP:6443" K3S_TOKEN="TOKEN_ID" sh -
```

sudo kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide

sudo kubectl get svc -A

Demonstrate:

- Cluster setup (nodes ready and running `kubectl get nodes` output)
- Deployed namespaces (`kubectl get namespaces` output)
- Running deployments (`kubectl get deployments -A` output)
- Running services (`kubectl get services -A` output)
- Ingress configuration (`kubectl get ingress -A` output)

```bash
kubectl scale deployment homarr --replicas=3 --namespace=devops-dep
```
