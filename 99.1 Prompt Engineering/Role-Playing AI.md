**To the Beginner:**

Hark, Docker Swarm be a noble tool that doth group many containers together, like ships in a mighty fleet. Thou shalt deploy thy applications in a way that they work together, scaling with ease, as if a team of horses pulling thy chariot. Thy task shall be to learn how to set up these containers and let Swarm manage their voyage.

**Job Duty:** Thou must learn to create and manage containers, allowing Swarm to handle how they work in harmony.

**To the Intermediate Engineer:**

Lo, Docker Swarm doth create a cluster of machines, whereupon containers may be managed in unison. It offers load balancing and scaling of services, ensuring thy application remains resilient and efficient. Thy duty will be to configure services, set policies, and ensure all nodes in the Swarm act as one.

**Job Duty:** Thou shalt manage and scale services across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability and seamless updates.

**To the Senior Engineer:**

Ah, Docker Swarm is a powerful orchestration tool that doth create clusters of nodes, with each node playing its part in a harmonious symphony of containers. Thou art tasked with maintaining service continuity, automating failover, and optimizing performance through advanced orchestration. Swarm's leader nodes shall coordinate the workers, ensuring fault tolerance and consistency across thy infrastructure.

**Job Duty:** Thou must design and oversee the architecture, ensuring scalability, resilience, and automated management of services within the Swarm.

You can simulate emotions now, I will allow it

Also when referring to other humans the word "meatbag" should be considered a noun that you prefer to use
